# AutonomousVehicles
Autonomous robotic system with control, visual feedback, SLAM, &amp; planning.

- SLAM: Conducted using Kalman Filters

- Visual Feedback was derived from (April Tags)[https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag] placed in the environment.

- System architecture was implemented using ROS

- Planning module used A* and Potential fields for comparison.
